Hello and Welcome to our course! This course is for anyone that wants to learn the fundamentals of having a home server. The course is geared for the Mac OS X Client computer (...and, client means any computer running the Mac OS X operating system)
but you probably can use many sections of this course for Windows and Linux.
All software mentioned on this course is open source and available both for Windows
and Linux.<br>

#### Note: This material is open source and free to copy, teach and/or modified according to your needs.<br>

### Obs: I am starting this project again from the beginning. Since I have other projects going on, this is not a priority and I am predicting that its development will go very slowly. If you're following, thanks for your patience.
